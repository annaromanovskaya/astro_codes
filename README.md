Abundplot.py - calculates chemical abundances (average or ions) from linelist table and plot this on figure with MSE errores.

Sedplot.py - read calculated and observed fluxes to two formats: interactive (zoom in, view data etc) and non-interactive for articles. Fluxes are converted into one format.

Spectrophotometry2erg.py - some functions for convertation of fluxes to ergs.

fits2lam.py - converts fits file from different spectrographs archives to 1D spectrum.
