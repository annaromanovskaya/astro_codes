Abundplot.py - calculates chamical abundances (average or ions) and plotes this on figure with MSE errores.
Sedplot.py - read calculated and observed fluxes to two formats: interactive (zoom in, view data etc) and non-interactive for articles. Fluxes are converted into one format.
Spectrophotometry2erg.py - some functions for convertation of fluxes to ergs.
fits2lam.py - converts fits file from difference spectrographs archives to 1D spectrum.
